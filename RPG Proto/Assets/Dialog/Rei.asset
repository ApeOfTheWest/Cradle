      way a bee\r\nshould be able to fly.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIts wings are too small to
      get\r\nits fat little body off the ground.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe bee, of course,
      flies anyway\r\n\r\n  \r\nbecause bees don't care\r\nwhat humans think is impossible.\r\n\r\n
      \ \r\nYellow, black. Yellow, black.\r\nYellow, black. Yellow, black.\r\n\r\n
      \ \r\nOoh, black and yellow!\r\nLet's shake it up a little.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBarry!
      Breakfast is ready!\r\n\r\n  \r\nOoming!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHang on a second.\r\n\r\n

      this is happening?\r\n- I can't. I'll pick you up.\r\n\r\n  \r\nLooking sharp.\r\n\r\n
      \ \r\nUse the stairs. Your father\r\npaid good money for those.\r\n\r\n  \r\nSorry.
      I'm excited.\r\n\r\n  \r\nHere's the graduate.\r\nWe're very proud of you, son.\r\n\r\n
      \ \r\nA perfect report card, all B's.\r\n\r\n  \r\nVery proud.\r\n\r\n  \r\nMa!
      I got a thing going here.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You got lint on your fuzz.\r\n- Ow!
      That's me!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.\r\n- Bye!\r\n\r\n
      \ \r\nBarry, I told you,\r\nstop flying in the house!\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hey, Adam.\r\n-
      Hey, Barry.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Is that fuzz gel?\r\n- A little. Special day, graduation.\r\n\r\n
      \ \r\nNever thought I'd make it.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThree days grade school,\r\nthree
      days high school.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThose were awkward.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThree days college.
      I'm glad I took\r\na day and hitchhiked around the hive.\r\n\r\n  \r\nYou did
      come back different.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hi, Barry.\r\n- Artie, growing a mustache?
      Looks good.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Hear about Frankie?\r\n- Yeah.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- You
      going to the funeral?\r\n- No, I'm not going.\r\n\r\n  \r\nEverybody knows,\r\nsting
      someone, you die.\r\n\r\n  \r\nDon't waste it on a squirrel.\r\nSuch a hothead.\r\n\r\n
      \ \r\nI guess he could have\r\njust gotten out of the way.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI love
      this incorporating\r\nan amusement park into our day.\r\n\r\n  \r\nThat's why
      we don't need vacations.\r\n\r\n  \r\nBoy, quite a bit of pomp...\r\nunder the
      circumstances.\r\n\r\n  \r\n- Well, Adam, today we are men.\r\n- We are!\r\n\r\n
      \ \r\n- Bee-men.\r\n- Amen!\r\n\r\n  \r\nHallelujah!\r\n\r\n  \r\nStudents,
